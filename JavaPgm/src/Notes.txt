if user seen some where double quotes - "<anything>"--- String


if string is coming first and after that  plus symbol is there next part automatically convert into the string


if user seen some where void symbol -- that is called a method


What is class ?

class is a combination of methods/variable , object and constrcutor.

if any thing is missing we can not execute our pgm

Note : constructor name and class name should be same  


what is object ?

Object is a replica of class or we can say blue print of class

WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver() // RTP


Constrcutor /MOL/OR /Inheritance / class and object 

Date: 29/09
//Assiangment - Create 4 class and each class should contain 3 methods all methods should call inside main method . 

>> Class 4 Cretaed A,B,C,D
>> Added method 
>> Created a object and invoke in main Method 



Inheritance :- Aquaring the properties from the above class - 
that is called a inheritance and we can achive with the help of extends keyword in java

What is Multi level inheritance

>>Step by step inheritance or we can say generation by generation transformation is called a Multi level inheritance


what is multiple inheritance

If one class want to inherit more than one class at a time 


can we achieve multiple inheritance in java

No , we cant achieve at class level but we can achieve at interface level

what is the major difference Multiple and multi level inheirtance


what is single inheritance and  inheritance both is same - child parent relation with extends keyword 

what is Many to one inheritance

What is one to Many Inheritance -- Multiple Inheritance -  Interface level 


Assignment :- 

IS-A Relation  >> what kind of inheritance >> this is single Inheritance 

Has-A realtion  >> What is 


Create a program for currency  and output should be whenever you are creating any object of any country that currency 
should printed

Create one pgm for Many to one relation 


Method over riding - Same methods but in differet class and implementation should be different
that is called method overriding and we can achieve with the help of extends keyword in java


Method Overloading :-  We have to apply same method but in same class but signature paramater/Data type shoudl be
differ


Data Type - 


by default any whole number is int

int -- whole Number ----- Middle range
long--- whole number -- higher range
short-- whole number-- less than integer and higher than byte
byte-- whole number-- less range


by default any decimal value is double

double--- decimal value --- high range
float -- decimal value--- Less range


char-- 'a' 'b'
boolean -- true and false

String - String is not a data type - it is a class but we will use like a data type - 
why? will discuss in String topic --- " "


Assingment : Write a programme to run the advance overloading with below data type. 

short-- whole number-- less than integer and higher than byte
byte-- whole number-- less range

short data type description:The short data type in Java is a 16-bit signed integer that can store values from -32,768 to 32,767. 
Itâ€™s often used when you need a smaller range of integer values to save memory.


int a= 'z';


******Framework*****

Page Object Model - can we design in multiple ways

Code always put into the git repo

jenkins - From The Git


Jenkins --- Pom.xml(Maven)-----TestNg.xml--- Scripting -- Main Functionality ---- We will declare Page Object Model --- fetching data from Excel /Db/Json



Where you store al
Key Feature

- developed Language of application
- Environment Support
- Easy to Use for team and they can able to write Script
- Complexity of The pgm
- Performance of the Scripting
- Integrated with CICD and Pipeline
- Logging
- Reporting
- Intergrated to Management Tool

remove duplicate character in a String ---  Set

Print Reverse String "Testing"  ---CharAt(i)

Constructor :- 

Constructor name and class name should be same

if user is not declaring any constructor - jvm will declare default and blank constructor

if user is declaring  any constructor - jvm will not declare any blank and default constructor

Constructor doesn't contain any return type - like void


Polymorphism :- Many form 

same object behaving different different instance through out the execution of the pgm - that is called a Polymorphism

Run Time polymorphism  -- Method Over riding , inheritance and upcasting

Trying to create a object of Parent class and call child Constructor

compile Time polymorphism --- Method Over loading

Complie time  Polymorphism is a method overloading  means its compiling at the time of execution 

Assignment - how we can say that method overloading is a part of compile time polymorphism
